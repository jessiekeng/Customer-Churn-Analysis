# Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

This project focuses on identifying high-risk customers for a telecommunications company. By prioritizing **Recall**, the model ensures that the majority of potential churners are captured for retention efforts.

## Key Technical Highlights
* **Optimized Detection:** Achieved **79% Recall** by tuning the classification threshold to **0.4**, ensuring the majority of churners are identified for proactive retention.
* **Imbalance Resolution:** Mitigated a 27% class imbalance using **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to ensure accurate pattern recognition in the minority churn group.
* **Validated Stability:** Confirmed a consistent **81.5% average recall** through **5-fold Cross-Validation**, proving model reliability across the entire dataset.

## Business Insights
The model identified **Fiber Optic service** and **high monthly charges** as the primary drivers of churn, suggesting that pricing or service quality in these segments are critical areas for business improvement.
